### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned what the inherit property does in terms of box-sizing.

### Continued development

I would like to dig a little deeper into my media queries, get comfortable with CSS Flexbox and Grid. I will continue to apply these in future projects to get a good feel on them.
